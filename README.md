# Kagebunshin-Mode

A mod that allows you to create clones that will run and scout the map. Also, just for fun, you can add a trail of different particles behind the character model.

In the first release of the mod, we simply wrote the main functionality, namely the creation of clones, their movement, and their exploration of the map. 
Also all sorts of small moments, like bugs in our own code and bugs that arose due to flaws or features of factorio API.



## Guide

Clones spawn if your hero runs liuom to a tree, with the "run" checkbox on, in Mod settings.
