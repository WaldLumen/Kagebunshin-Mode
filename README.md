# Kagebunshin-Mode

Factorio mod that allows you to create clones that will run and scout the map. Also, just for fun, you can add a trail of different particles behind the character model.





## Guide

Clones spawn if your hero runs to a tree, with the "Spawn Clones" checkbox on, in Mod settings.

In order for the mod to be adequately eaten by factorio, you need to rename the Kagebunshin-Mode-master folder to Kagebunshin-mode_2.1.2
